        <blockquote>"When Andy joined Arria, he helped me build both a team of writers and a massive docset. He single-handedly delivered high-quality documentation for Arria's core product while forming strong relationships with developers and other SMEs. He earned the respect and affection of the entire Technology group; his departure is a tremendous loss for Arria, but a huge win for his next team."</blockquote>

Although Andy had no previous experience of the product or the tools being used to create our training materials, he picked up everything extremely quickly. Andy's writing skills, attention to detail, and high standards helped to ensure that the materials we provided were delivered on target and of the highest quality."</blockquote>
