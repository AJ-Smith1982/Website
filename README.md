# Website

I'm Andy Smith, an Aberdeen-based technical writer. In the forlorn hope of finding work before AI assistants render me as archaic as a floppy disk, I've built a website to showcase my work.

Because I'm ~~passionate about learning web development~~ dumb AF, I've built it from scratch. Why use templated solutions when you can risk a full psychotic break writing native HTML, CSS, and JS files?

Though published, the site remains a work in progress â€” for the love of Jebus, don't view the site on a mobile! Nevertheless, I seem to have cobbled together something that sorta works. Yay me, probably...
