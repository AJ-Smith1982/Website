# Website

I'm Andy Smith, an Aberdeen-based technical writer. In the forlorn hope of finding work before AI assistants render me as archaic as a floppy disk, I am building a website to showcase my work.

Because I'm ~~passionate about learning web development~~ dumber than a bag of rocks, I'm building it from scratch. Why use templated solutions when you can risk a psychotic break writing native HTML, CSS and JS?
