# Website

I'm Andy Smith, an Aberdeen-based technical writer. In a bid to find employment before AI assistants render me as outdated as the floppy disk, I am building a website to showcase my work.

Because I'm ~~passionate about learning web development~~ dumb, I'm building it from scratch. Why use helpful templated solutions when you can risk a psychotic depressive break writing  native HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

GitHub, that hallowed repository of the world's coding triumphs and tragedies, seemed like the perfect stage to showcase this folly.
